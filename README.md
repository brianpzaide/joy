# joy
```Joy``` is a tiny creative coding library in Python, created by [@anandology](https://github.com/anandology/joy).
I love the ```Joy``` project, I wanted to make it accessible to everyone, ```Joy``` now runs completely in the browser. 
This was only possible because of the amazing projects [Pyodide](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide), [Jupyterlite](https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite), [Jupyterlite-sphinx](https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite-sphinx).
